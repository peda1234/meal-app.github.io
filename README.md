Functionality used-
1>get data from API and convert it into JSON object
2>add meal items in grid format into home page.
3>added favourite button to add items into favourite list
4>view details to see the details about the meals like( image, name, video link, instruction, ingredients etc)
5>remove items from favourite list
6>added meal items data into browser local storage.
7>remove meal items from local storage.

Enhancement yet to be done to increse the efficiency and decrease loading time -

1> instead of attaching event listener to every items , we use Event bubbling concept to increase efficiency.
2> use Pagination to divide mealitems into different pages ,it will reduce time to load te items.
3> Handle corner cases using try/catch.
